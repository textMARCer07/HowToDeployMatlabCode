# HowToDeployMatlabCode
This Repository gives a tutorial on how to deploy MATLAB-Code within other languages.
Provided are five example-functions deployed in Python and JavaScript.

The underlying workflow can be used to deploy MATLAB-Functions in every language, that provides any sort of usage of C-Code.
The workflow makes use of the "MATLAB Coder"-Toolbox to create a library with using C-Code (.dll or .so) containing the translated functions and necessary function-depencies.



## Explanation of Function-Functionality:

### TestModelSimple:
The first Function takes one input value and multiplies it by 7
###### input * 7 = result
\n

### TestModelDoubleInput:
The Second function takes two inputs, adds them and multiplies the addition by 9
###### (input1 + input2) * 9 = result


### TestModelDoubleInOut:


### TestModelSingleInOutVariable:


### TestModelSingleInOutArray:
